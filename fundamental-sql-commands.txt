Exercises
Use the commands above to complete the following tasks, and submit the SQL statements. Real-world s must be distinct from those used in the text.

1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

A:
1. CREATE TABLE example (column1 text, column2 integer, column3 timestamp);

2. INSERT INTO example (column1, column2, column3) VALUES ('row1', 101, '2019-09-17 12:01:00'), ('row2', 102, '2019-09-17 12:02:00'), ('row3', 103, '2019-09-17 12:03:00');

3. UPDATE example SET column2 = 202 WHERE column1 = 'row2';

4. DELETE FROM example WHERE column1 = 'row3';

5. ALTER TABLE example ADD COLUMN column4 text;

6. ALTER TABLE example DROP COLUMN column4;

7. DROP TABLE example;

2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

A:
1. CREATE TABLE Creates a table and adds columns (i.e. column1, column2, column3).

2. INSERT INTO Inserts data (values) into the columns. The VALUES are written to the table from left to right one row at a time.

3. UPDATE Updates the table while SET defines the column and new data. WHERE defines a column and row.

4. DELETE FROM Deletes from value from cell. WHERE defines a column and row.

5. ALTER TABLE Updates schema of a table. ADD COLUMN Adds a new column and defines data type.

6. ALTER TABLE Updates schema of a table. DROP COLUMN Removes column of specified name.

7. DROP TABLE Deletes the entire table.

3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world  of each type.

A:
Text - A type of employee in an employee database (i.e. ‘Software designer’)
Timestamp - A time and date of the original creation and therefore hire date of an employee.
Numeric - An employee ID number.
Money - A hourly wage for an employee.
Boolean - Whether or not the employee is on salary or is paid hourly.

4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

* Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?

* First and last name.
A:text

* Whether they sent in their RSVP.
A:boolean

* Number of guests.
A:integer

* Number of meals.
A:numeric

* Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.
A:
CREATE TABLE wedding (
  name text,
  rsvp boolean,
  guests, integer,
  meals numeric(2, 1)
);

* Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
A:
ALTER TABLE wedding
  ADD COLUMN thankyou boolean;

* You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
A:
ALTER TABLE wedding
  DROP COLUMN meals;

* The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
A:
ALTER TABLE wedding
  ADD COLUMN tablenumber;

* The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
A:
DROP TABLE wedding;

5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

A:
CREATE TABLE library (
  isbn integer,
  title text,
  author text,
  genre text,
  publishingdate date,
  copies integer,
  available integer
);

* Find three books and add their information to the table.
A:
INSERT INTO library (isbn, title, author, genre, publishingdate, copies, available) 
  VALUES 
  (9780531002469, 'Mythology', 'Edith Hamilton', 'Greek Literature', '1968-06-01', 2, 1),
  (9780316769501, 'Nine Stories', 'J.D. Salinger', 'Classic Literature & Fiction', '1991-05-01', 5, 3),
  (9781613820483, 'The Metamorphosis', 'Franz Kafka', 'Classic Literature & Fiction', '2011-05-19', 3, 1);

* Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
A:
UPDATE library
  SET available = 0
  WHERE title = 'The Metamorphosis';

* Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

A:
DELETE FROM library
  WHERE isbn = 9780316769501;


6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

A:
CREATE TABLE spacecraft (
  id = integer,
  name = text,
  launched = date,
  country = text,
  mission = text,
  orbit = text,
  operating = boolean,
  distance = float
);

* Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
A:
INSERT INTO spacecraft (id, name, launched, country, mission, orbit, operating, distance)
  VALUES
  (10002, 'Enterprise', '2018-04-12', 'USA', 'Recon', 'Zeta-1', true, 12345678),
  (56473, 'SpaceShip1', '2043-03-30', 'USSSA', 'Search for water on distant moons', 'Titan', false, 76543),
  (53764, 'SuperShip2', '2112-03-02', 'MEXICO', 'Search for ore rich asteroids', 'Vesta', true, 362737);

* Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
A:
DELETE FROM spacecraft
  WHERE id = 10002;
* Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
A:
UPDATE spacecraft
  SET operating = false
  WHERE id = 53764;

7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:

A:
CREATE TABLE inbox (
  id = integer,
  subject = text,
  sender = text,
  addrecipients = text,
  body = text,
  received = timestamp,
  read = boolean,
  chain = integer
);

* Add three new emails to the inbox.
A:
INSERT INTO inbox (id, subject, sender, addrecipients, body, received, read, chain)
  VALUES
  (2112, 'Free Stuff', 'Bad Guy21@email.com', 'Other@email.com', 'Here is some free stuff that will give you malware!', '2019-09-17 11:32:09', false, 21)
  (2113, 'Order Sent', 'eztailShop@email.com', 'etailrecords@email.com', 'Your order has been sent', '2019-09-17 13:03:54', true, 54)
  (2114, 'Pick me up?', 'friend@email.com', 'Otherfriend@email.com', 'Can you pick me up after work?', '2019-09-17 16:59:59', true, 79);

* You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
A:
DELETE FROM inbox
  WHERE id = 2112;

* You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.
A:
UPDATE inbox
  SET read = false
  WHERE id = 2114;
